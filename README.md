# Toys R ust Server
This repo holds my working Rust server designed to support multiple services, currently some features implemented for the CLI and email_services modules.
I plan on using this backend to support my personal website, but I'm not limited the backend features to my website. 

### Usage
1. Clone repo

2. Following command creates the release and calls the binary using admin.
``` 
sudo sh build.,sh
```
3. You should now be listening on port localhost:80
  - Plan on supporting options on build.sh for specifying ip and ports
